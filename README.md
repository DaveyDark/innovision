# Innovision
Repositiory for our Team(Innovision) Hackathon 2023 project at GNDEC

This project is intended to be a sports management website for the sports department at GNDEC. 
It has some basic frontend webpages showcasing different sports, as well as an event system which allows the admins to create and add events to the database which
will show up in the website. It also has an account system for students and students can register for these events online on the webstie itself after creating an account.
The admins have the right to approve or deny any registerations for events with restricted entries. Open events are open for anyone to register in.
